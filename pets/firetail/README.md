# Firetail

> Firetail — a chubby charcoal-purple scaled salamander on four planted legs, warm orange underbelly, orange-capped toes, big amber eyes, and a single flat opaque flame at the tip of a tail that arcs up over its back.

## Every animation, and what plays it

Rows 9 and 10 are the **16 look directions**: as you move your cursor, the pet's head turns to follow it, in 22.5° steps.

The pet is drawn the **same size in every lane** (spread 6%), so it does not visibly resize when you hover or drag it.

## QA

```
firetail PASS key=#00FFFF lean=0.0% ring=9% spread=7%
```

`lean` = pixels still tinted by the chroma key · `ring` = background baked into the sprite · `spread` = how much the pet resizes between lanes. All must be near zero.

## The base art everything was generated from

<p align="center">

</p>

Every one of the 88 drawings in the atlas was generated against this single canonical reference, which is what keeps the identity stable across all of them.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh --pet firetail
```

Then **Codex Settings → Appearance / Pets**, and `/pet` to wake it.
